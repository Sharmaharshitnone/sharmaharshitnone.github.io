# Chandashastra (Prosody) - Part 1

## Introduction to Chandashastra

Chandashastra, the science of prosody in Indian knowledge systems, represents one of the most sophisticated approaches to poetic meter and rhythm in world literature. This ancient discipline systematically analyzes the patterns of syllables, sounds, and pauses that create poetic structure.

## Historical Development

### Vedic Origins

- **Earliest Sources**: The study of meter originated with Vedic compositions (1500-500 BCE)
- **Rigveda**: Contains hymns in various meters, showing early metrical awareness
- **Significance**: Proper meter was essential for ritual efficacy
- **Early Centers**: [Kurukshetra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurukshetra) region and the [Sarasvati River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarasvati_River) valley were early centers of Vedic prosody

### Classical Period Development

- **Pingala's Contribution**: Chandahsutra/Chandahshastra (c. 300-200 BCE) established systematic prosody
- **Bharata's Natya Shastra**: Incorporated prosodic elements into dramatic theory
- **Royal Patronage**: Courts in [Pataliputra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pataliputra) and [Ujjain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjain) supported prosodic studies
- **Regional Variations**: Different regions developed distinctive metrical preferences

### Medieval Innovations

- **Jayadeva's Gita Govinda**: Introduced complex musical meters (12th century CE)
- **Regional Adaptations**: Regional languages developed their own prosodic systems
- **Theoretical Expansions**: Commentaries elaborated existing theories
- **Major Centers**: [Varanasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi) and [Kashmir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir) became important medieval centers for prosodic studies

## Fundamental Concepts in Chandas

### Basic Units of Measurement

- **Varna (Syllable)**: The fundamental building block of meters
  - **Hrasva**: Short syllable (1 matra)
  - **Dirgha**: Long syllable (2 matras)
  - **Pluta**: Prolonged syllable (3 matras)
- **Matra**: Time unit of syllabic duration
- **Gana**: Group of three syllables used for pattern classification
- **Yati**: Caesura or pause within a verse
- **Pada**: Quarter verse or line

### Classification of Syllables

- **Laghu (Light)**: Short syllable marked as '⏑' or 'U'
- **Guru (Heavy)**: Long syllable marked as '−' or '-'
- **Determination Rules**:
  - Naturally short vowels followed by two or more consonants become heavy
  - All naturally long vowels are heavy
  - Short vowels at the end of a pada may be considered heavy (pada-vrtta)

### Ganas (Syllable Groups)

- **Eight Triglyph Patterns**: Groups of three syllables denoted by mnemonic words:
  - ma = maaaa (− − −): all long
  - na = naagaa (⏑ − −): short followed by two long
  - bha = bhaavaa (− ⏑ −): long, short, long
  - ya = yaatraa (⏑ − ⏑): short, long, short
  - ja = jarala (⏑ ⏑ −): two shorts followed by a long
  - ra = ramana (− ⏑ ⏑): long followed by two shorts
  - sa = sarala (⏑ ⏑ ⏑): all short
  - ta = taaraka (− − ⏑): two longs followed by a short
- **Mnemonic Verse**: "ma-na-bha-ya-ja-ra-sa-ta" helps memorize the patterns

## Major Categories of Meters

### Varna Vrttas (Syllabic Meters)

- **Definition**: Fixed patterns of light and heavy syllables
- **Classification**: Organized by the number of syllables per quarter (pada)
- **Examples**:
  - **Anustubh**: 8 syllables per quarter (32 per verse)
  - **Trishtubh**: 11 syllables per quarter (44 per verse)
  - **Jagati**: 12 syllables per quarter (48 per verse)

### Matra Vrttas (Moraic Meters)

- **Definition**: Based on fixed number of matras (time units) rather than syllables
- **Flexibility**: Allow variable syllable counts with fixed total duration
- **Examples**:
  - **Arya**: 12+18+12+15 matras in four lines
  - **Giti**: 12+18+12+18 matras in four lines
  - **Vaitaliyas**: Various patterns with set matra counts

### Jati Meters

- **Definition**: Mixed meters combining features of both varna and matra vrttas
- **Applications**: Often used in dramatic compositions
- **Regional Variations**: Different traditions developed distinctive jati meters

## Vedic Meters

### Principal Vedic Meters

- **Gayatri**: 3 padas of 8 syllables each (24 total)
- **Ushnik**: 3 padas (8+8+12 syllables)
- **Anushtubh**: 4 padas of 8 syllables each (32 total)
- **Brihati**: 4 padas (8+8+12+8 syllables)
- **Pankti**: 5 padas of 8 syllables each
- **Trishtubh**: 4 padas of 11 syllables each
- **Jagati**: 4 padas of 12 syllables each

### Ritual Significance

- **Deity Associations**: Specific meters associated with particular deities
  - Gayatri with Agni
  - Trishtubh with Indra
  - Jagati with Vishvedevas
- **Ritual Applications**: Particular meters prescribed for specific ceremonies
- **Symbolic Meanings**: Meters connected to cosmic principles and natural elements
- **Sacred Geography**: Certain meters associated with specific sacred locations like [Prayaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triveni_Sangam) (modern Allahabad)

### Vedic Recitation Patterns

- **Samhita Path**: Continuous recitation
- **Pada Path**: Word-by-word recitation
- **Krama Path**: Sequential overlapping pattern
- **Ghana Path**: Complex recitation pattern emphasizing metrical structure
- **Regional Traditions**: Different regions preserved distinctive recitation styles

## Classical Sanskrit Meters

### Epic and Shloka Meters

- **Anushtubh/Shloka**: Standard 32-syllable meter used in epics and puranas
  - Pattern: 8 syllables per quarter with specific constraints on 5th-8th positions

- **Malini**: 15 syllables per pada with distinctive rhythm
- **Mandakranta**: 17 syllables per pada, favored for emotional poetry

- **Arya**: Moraic meter popular in dramatic and lyrical works
- **Dandaka**: Extended meter with 27+ syllables per line
- **Matrachhandas**: Meters based on matra count rather than syllable patterns
- **Regional Innovations**: Courts across India developed specialized meters for specific literary purposes

## Technical Achievements

### Mathematical Analysis

- **Binary Notation**: Used binary-like notation system to describe meters
- **Meru Prastara**: Pascal's triangle-like arrangement of metrical possibilities
- **Mathematical Centers**: [Ujjain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjain) was a significant center for mathematical prosody

### Notation Systems

- **Laghu-Guru Notation**: Light and heavy syllables marked with specific symbols
- **Gaṇa Notation**: Three-syllable groups denoted by mnemonic syllables
- **Numerical Systems**: Various numerical codes to represent metrical patterns
