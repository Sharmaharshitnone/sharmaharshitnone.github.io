## Classical Indian Music Traditions

Indian classical music represents one of the oldest, most complex, and sophisticated musical systems in the world. Its origins can be traced back to the Vedic period, with the chanting of hymns and ritual music. Over millennia, it evolved into distinct traditions while maintaining core theoretical principles.

### Historical Development

1. **Vedic Origins (1500-500 BCE)**

   - [Sama Veda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sama_Veda) contains the earliest notated music
   - Three-note scale (udgātṛ) developed into seven-note scale
   - Ritual chanting established patterns of recitation

2. **Classical Codification (200 BCE-500 CE)**

   - [Natyashastra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natyashastra) by Bharata Muni established musical theory
   - Outlined jatis (melodic frameworks) and murchanas (modes)
   - Described instruments, vocal styles, and performance contexts

3. **Medieval Development (500-1200 CE)**
