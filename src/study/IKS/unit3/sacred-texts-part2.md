## Smriti Literature (स्मृति) - "That Which is Remembered"

[Smriti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti) texts are considered "remembered" or authored texts, composed by sages and scholars to interpret and apply the principles of Shruti literature.

### Significance of Dharmashastra Literature

Dharmashastra texts served multiple functions in ancient Indian society:

1. **Legal Framework**: They provided the foundation for legal systems and judicial procedures across various Indian kingdoms.

2. **Social Organization**: They outlined the structure of society, including the varna (class) and ashrama (stage of life) systems.

3. **Ethical Guidelines**: They established moral principles and virtues to be cultivated by individuals.

4. **Adaptive Nature**: Unlike modern legal codes, Dharmashastra recognized the principle of desha-kala-patra (place-time-circumstance), allowing for contextual application of laws.

5. **Balance Between Individual and Society**: These texts aimed to balance individual freedoms with social harmony.

## Evolution and Interpretation

The Dharmashastra literature evolved over time, with later commentaries (bhashya) and digests (nibandha) adapting the principles to changing social conditions. Prominent commentators included:

- **[Vijnaneshwara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vij%C3%B1%C4%81ne%C5%9Bvara)** (11th century CE) - Authored Mitakshara, a commentary on Yajnavalkya Smriti
- **[Jimutavahana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimutavahana)** (11th-12th century CE) - Authored Dayabhaga, influential in Bengal legal tradition
- **[Kulluka Bhatta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulluka_Bhatta)** (15th century CE) - Wrote an influential commentary on Manusmriti

## Regional Variations

Different regions of India developed their own interpretations and applications of Dharmashastra:

1. **Mitakshara School** - Prevalent in most of India except Bengal and Assam
2. **Dayabhaga School** - Prominent in Bengal and Assam
3. **Regional Legal Texts** - Such as Kerala's Shankarasmriti

## Modern Relevance

While many aspects of Dharmashastra have been superseded by modern legal systems, they continue to influence:

1. Personal law for Hindus in matters of marriage, adoption, and inheritance
2. Cultural norms and ethical thinking
3. Scholarly understanding of traditional Indian jurisprudence and social philosophy

Through their comprehensive approach to law, ethics, and social organization, the Dharmashastra texts represent a sophisticated attempt to create a society based on dharma (righteousness, duty, cosmic order), balancing individual freedom with social harmony.
