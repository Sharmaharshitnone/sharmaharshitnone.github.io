# History of Indian Knowledge System

## Prehistoric and Early Origins (10,000 BCE - 3000 BCE)

Archaeological evidence from sites like [Bhimbetka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimbetka_rock_shelters) (Madhya Pradesh) and [Mehrgarh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrgarh) (Balochistan) suggests that knowledge systems in the Indian subcontinent date back to prehistoric times.
